1. Examine why so many subjects have sMRI_use_for_5ttgen_mcrib equal to 0? - has to be probably changed.
done

2. In dMRI_5ttgen make sure we prefer 1 over 0.5:
# If we have a session.tsv file, use this
if [ -f $sessionfile ]; then
    # Read $sessionfile and use entries to create relevant files
    {
	counter=0
	read
	while IFS= read -r line
	do
	    # check if the file/image has passed QC (qc_pass_fail = 4th column)
	    QCPass=`echo "$line" | awk '{ print $4 }'`

        if [ $QCPass == 1 ] || [ $QCPass  == 0.5 ] ; then
            #### Read flags in session.tsv file with corresponding column index
            ## Flag for use of sMRI in 5ttgen mcrib (sMRI_use_for_5ttgen_mcrib = 9th column)

            #NEW CODE START
            file=`echo "$line" | awk '{ print $3 }'`
            echo $file
            
            #if has MCRIB in name then select is as the file
            if echo "$file" | grep -q "MCRIB"; then
                echo "IS VALID"
                filebase=`basename $file .nii.gz`
                filedir=`dirname $file`
                let counter++
                if [ ! -f $datadir/anat/$filebase.mif.gz ]; then
                    cp $origdatadir/$filedir/$filebase.nii.gz $origdatadir/$filedir/$filebase.json $datadir/.
                fi
            else
                echo "IS NOT VALID"
            fi
done

3. revisit  sub23 sessionQC.

4. Add eddy_quad instruction to get the CNR plots too (preprocess)

5. rerun pipeline for 1 subject and check if it is ok

6. group response function - add script, look into mrtrix documentation. 

7. verify that CNR maps are created. -> check qc/quad.

8. Adapt visualisation script.  - DONE. 

9. Add NODDI analysis to pipeline.  - DONE.
